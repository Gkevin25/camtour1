                <p>
                  CamTour was founded in 2020 by a group of passionate Cameroonian travel enthusiasts who saw the need
                  for authentic, responsible tourism experiences in their beautiful country. What began as a small
                  operation offering guided hikes up Mount Cameroon has grown into Cameroon&apos;s premier tour operator.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our mission is to showcase the incredible diversity of Cameroon - often called &quot;Africa in Miniature&quot; -
                  while supporting local communities and preserving the natural environment. We believe that tourism,
                  when done right, can be a powerful force for positive change.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today, CamTour offers a wide range of experiences across Cameroon, from wildlife safaris to cultural
                  immersions, beach getaways to mountain adventures. What hasn&apos;t changed is our commitment to
                  authenticity, sustainability, and creating unforgettable memories for our guests.

/*
The provided code defines a React component for an "About" page in a Next.js application, which is structured to present information about a travel company called CamTour. The code begins with several import statements that bring in necessary components and libraries. The `Image` component from Next.js is used for optimized image loading, while the `Link` component facilitates client-side navigation. The `Button`, `Card`, and `CardContent` components are imported from a UI library, likely for consistent styling across the application. Additionally, `MainNav` and `Footer` components are imported to provide navigation and footer functionality on the page.

The `AboutPage` function is defined as the default export of the module. Inside this function, the return statement contains JSX that structures the layout of the page. The outermost `div` uses flexbox to create a column layout that spans the full height of the screen. The header section is sticky, ensuring it remains at the top during scrolling, and includes a logo linked to the home page, navigation links, and a placeholder for additional elements.

The main content area is divided into several sections. The first section is a hero section featuring a background image with a dark overlay, a title, and a brief description of CamTour. Following this, the "Our Story" section provides a narrative about the company's founding, mission, and growth, accompanied by an image representing the team. The "Our Values" section highlights the company's core principles, such as authenticity, sustainability, and community impact, using cards to present each value with an associated icon.

The "Meet Our Team" section introduces key team members, showcasing their roles and bios, along with their images. The "Testimonials" section features a client review, emphasizing the positive experiences of past customers. The "Our Partners" section lists organizations that collaborate with CamTour to promote sustainable tourism. Finally, a call-to-action (CTA) section encourages visitors to explore Cameroon, offering buttons for browsing tours and contacting the company.

The layout is responsive, utilizing CSS utility classes for styling, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly experience across different devices.
